    <b>Destructurnig assignment is used to unpack values from an array, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution. In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.</b>
